# What is a data dictionary?
A data dictionary is a document that provides detailed descriptions of each variable or attribute within a dataset. It serves as a glossary that defines the meaning, format, origin, and other relevant characteristics of each variable.

## Why is it important?

* **Understanding the data:** It allows all team members to have a clear and unified view of the data.
* **Ensuring quality:** It helps identify potential errors or inconsistencies in the data.
* **Facilitating analysis:** It provides the necessary information to select the appropriate variables for analysis and build models.
* **Documenting the project:** It serves as a reference for future analyses and related projects.

* Variable name: Clear and concise name that identifies the variable.
