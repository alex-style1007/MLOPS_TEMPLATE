Project Charter: Your Data Science Project

This document serves as the cornerstone of our data science project. In it, we will clearly define the objectives, scope, responsibilities, and resources required to successfully carry out the project.

What will this document contain?

    Project Overview:
        A concise description of the problem we seek to solve or the opportunity we want to take advantage of.
        The project's justification: Why is this project important to the organization?
        Specific and measurable objectives.
    Project Scope:
        What is included and what is excluded from the project.
        Project limits in terms of time, resources, and functionalities.
    Project Team:
        Roles and responsibilities of each team member.
        Project leader and their responsibilities.
    Timeline:
        Key start, end, and milestone dates.
        Dependencies between different tasks.
    Resources:
        Data, tools, software, and hardware requirements.
        Budget allocated to the project.
    Success Criteria:
        How we will measure the project's success.
        Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    Risk Management:
        Identification of potential risks that could affect the project.
        Mitigation plans for each risk.
        Risk communication and escalation process.
    Communication:
        Frequency of team meetings.
        Communication channels (email, collaboration tools).
        Decision-making process.

Why is this document important?

    Ensures alignment: All team members will have a clear understanding of the project's objectives and expectations.
    Facilitates decision-making: It serves as a reference for resolving doubts and making decisions throughout the project.
    Measures progress: It allows for tracking the project's progress and adjusting course if necessary.
    Reduces risks: By identifying and mitigating risks in advance, the likelihood of project success is increased.

Next steps:

Once we have finalized this document, we can begin working on the next stage of the TDSP process, which is understanding the data.
